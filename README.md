# Arma Wiki Scraper
A scrapy project to retrieve documentation information from the Bohemia Interactive Studios community wiki.

Outputs the following information for each BIS function and command:

`name`: The function/command name.

`link`: The link to the wiki page for the function/command.

`description`: The full description from the page (some BIS functions pages have placeholder descriptions generated by the function viewer output, these have not been omitted or reduced).

`game_added`: the state the engine was in when the function/command was added (e.g. "Arma 3 v1.72").


See output.json for current output
